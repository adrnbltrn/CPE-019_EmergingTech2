A connection object is created using sqlite3.connect(); the connection must be closed at the end of the session with the .close() command.

It served as a sort of refresher because the last time that we used SQL was back in our Database Management subject which was 1 year ago. Before the activity, I knew some of the syntax that I needed to use but there were also tasks which I did not know how to do. By accomplishing the first three tasks, I was able to re-gain the knowledge that I had because it was refreshed in my mind. All-in-all, this activity served its purpose as a refresher course for DBMS queries and I am sure that I will be able to use it in our future activities if I am required."],"metadata":{"id":"BPa9_9K4l5xJ"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
